\section{Related Work}

We position CacheMedic++ at the intersection of (i) KV-cache corruption and manipulation, (ii) KV-cache interventions for behavior control, and (iii) stability and internal editing methods.

\paragraph{KV-cache corruption and manipulation.} Prior work shows that perturbing cached keys/values can destabilize outputs or induce targeted behaviors without modifying model weights \cite{hossain2025mti,nahian2025cachetrap,ganesh2025historyswap}.

\paragraph{KV interventions and steering.} Several methods directly manipulate internal states for steering or defense objectives, motivating targeted interventions at inference time \cite{conceptor2024}.

\paragraph{Stability and internal editing.} Activation-level constraints and editing techniques motivate framing internal state edits as operators with explicit stability properties \cite{sea2024,abd2025acl}.

We differ by introducing a learned KV-specific repair operator with explicit contraction regularization and by treating stability metrics as primary results.
