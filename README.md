# CacheMedic++ Harness v1.1

This is an **executable research harness**: specs, configs, schemas, runbooks, and a paper skeleton for implementing **CacheMedic++**.

Start here: `AGENTS.md`.

Operational runbook for paper work: `docs/exec-plans/40_SWEETSPOT_PAPER_OPERATIONS.md`.
Live run status board for pause/resume tracking: `docs/exec-plans/35_SWEETSPOT_STATUS_BOARD.md`.

To run harness checks:
```bash
bash scripts/smoke_repo.sh
```

The ML implementation is expected to be generated by Codex under `empty_dirs_for_codex/src/` following the CLI contract in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Current status (2026-02-15)
- Core package and CLI entrypoints are implemented under `empty_dirs_for_codex/src/cachemedicpp/`.
- Fail-closed behavior is active for `train`, `eval`, and `stability` (`device: cuda` errors when CUDA is unavailable).
- Training is completed for `empty_dirs_for_codex/outputs/runs/mve_gpu_20260215_121245` (`12000/12000`).
- `train` supports checkpointed pause/resume with heartbeat telemetry.
- `eval` now supports progress-based pause/resume with heartbeat telemetry.
- `stability` now supports progress-based pause/resume with heartbeat telemetry.
- `watch` now reads latest phase heartbeat (`train/eval/stability`) and shows phase-aware progress.
- `sweep` supports resume-aware phase orchestration and respects sweep-level pause requests.
- Sweet-spot configs for paper throughput are available:
  - `configs/fast_paper_base.yaml`
  - `configs/fast_paper_sweep_core.yaml`
  - `configs/fast_second_model_gpt2_large.yaml`
- Operational details and exact commands live in:
  - `docs/exec-plans/40_SWEETSPOT_PAPER_OPERATIONS.md`
  - `docs/exec-plans/35_SWEETSPOT_STATUS_BOARD.md`
