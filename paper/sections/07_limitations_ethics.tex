\section{Limitations and Ethics}

This work evaluates stability under a reproducible set of corruption operators. Real-world faults may differ in distribution and timing. The method assumes access to model internals to insert the repair operator.

We treat the work as defensive robustness research. The harness avoids distributing exploit automation beyond minimal corruption operators required for evaluation.
