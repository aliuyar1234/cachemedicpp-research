# Changelog - CacheMedic++ Research Repository

## Current
- Added paper source/output naming cleanup (`cachemedicpp_paper.tex`, `cachemedicpp_paper.pdf`).
- Promoted a compact, reviewer-facing `evidence/` tree and aligned paper references to it.
- Removed legacy handoff bundles and non-essential internal docs from the tracked repo state.
- Reduced repository noise by removing tracked runtime outputs under `empty_dirs_for_codex/outputs/`.
- Updated manifest tooling exclusions for internal/runtime artifacts and LaTeX build byproducts.

## Previous releases
- Initial releases established CLI contracts, schemas, smoke checks, and paper scaffold.
